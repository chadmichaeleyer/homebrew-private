# Discussion on Chapter 2 [@decenzo2013fundamental-of-human-resource]

1. No organization exists without its people and neither can an company achieve its goals without strategic use of its people. If the four management functions vital to meeting company goals are planning, organizing, leading, and controlling, then human resource managers work in each of these domains: 

    * shaping organizational strategy (planning)
    * creating on organizational structure (organizing)
    * acquiring personnel with the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities; keeping personnel motivated and engaged (leading)
    * evaluating, rewarding, and correcting employee performance (controlling)

    No single function is more or less important than another for a strategic human resource manager.

2. Human resource management connects organizational goals with the activities of the organization's people. The four human resource management functions are staffing, training and development, motivation, and maintenance. Typical human resource tasks related to these functions include:

    * staffing: employment planning, recruiting, and selection
    * training and development: employee orientation (cultural socialization), training (in skills related to current role), employee development (towards other positions with a company), and career development (assiting employees achieve their career goals), organizational development (change management)
    * motivation: meeting employee's needs to increase productivity, setting performance standards and providing feedback based ot tose standards
    * maintenance: providing communication to employees, employee benefit/welfare programs, completing transactional human resource tasks (compensation)

3. Staffing begings with creating or revising an employment plan which will map a company's strategic plan and objectives to the specific knowledge, skills, and abilities needed. This planning involves job analysis, creating job descriptions, creating compensation plans and identifying the number of positions necessary for each job type. Next, staffing professionals recruit, targeting efforts toward locating good applicants. The final step in staffing involves selecting employees from an applicant pool based clear communication around culture and expectations and assessments designed to measure how well applicants will fit the culture and expectations. 

4. Training and development begins following employee selection, through an employee orientation program designed to acculturate new employees to the organization. Job-specific employee training ensures that each employee has the skills necessary to succeed in their current job. Employee development creates a pool of internal talent able to fill future positions within an organization. Career development assists employees identify and make progress toward their career goals. Organizational development helps companies manage employee's response to strategic changes within the organization.

5. Motivation involves managing employee behavior such that employees are willing to perform their roles well. This begins with the staffing (are the role and employee a good fit for each other?) and training/development (does the employee have the skills to be successfil in the role?) functions. Motivated employees will also feel that their job is well designed, have access to apporpiate tools and technology to perform their role, feel respected as individuals, feel empowered and engaged in their role, know what is expected of them and how their success will be measured, and have clear paths towards improvement and advancement. (This list reminds me of [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs) from my education classes.) Employee performance evaluations and compensation are also key factors in motivation.
 
6. The maintenance function of human resource management deals mostly with employee communication and retention. Communication (through various channels: monodirectional, bidirectional, 360Â°) is important to keeping employees engaged. This engagement translates to employee loyalty and retention. Also important to retention are employee benefit programs that keep employees safe, healthy, and happy.

7. If the people of an organization are necessary for an organization to meet its goals, then human resource management plays a role in setting and fulfilling an those goals. @decenzo2013fundamental-of-human-resource [p. 32] states that "[a]ll employees should see the link between their daily tasks and achievement of a purpose or goal". This link comes from the successful execution of the four human resource functions listed above. @decenzo2013fundamental-of-human-resource [p. 32] further states that "[s]uperior HR practices, including hiring the right people to support company strategy, seem to support productivity and profitability". 

8. Small business owners will likely perform all functions of human resource management, often in conjunction with any other operational or support roles they may perform. A small business is not exempt from sound human resource management practices. Instead, carefully attention to human resource management can promote employee retention, keeping long-term labor costs down and helping a small business grom.

9. Though it could be argued that the human resource management functions together start with the foundation of the strategic employment plan (part of the staffing function), each function is interrelated. (Even such that an organization that excels in the maintenance function may improve employee retention to the point that staffing becames a non-issue.) As each function depends on every other function, no single human resource management function is more or less important than another.
