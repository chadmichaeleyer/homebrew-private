# Discussion on Chapter 1 [@decenzo2013fundamental-of-human-resource]

1. In the past fifty years, multinational corporations have become more common. Multinational corporations are global businesses that operate in multiple countries at the same time, each country with different populations and cultures. economic, ethical, and legal environments that often vary widely from one another. Human resource managers' careful consideration of the diverse demographics of these countries, together with the diverse economic, ethical, and legal environments (be they pronounced or subtle), is key to success in a global marketplace.

2. The advance of technology has propelled commerce throughout modern history. The most recent era of globalization (beginning ca. 2000 with the rise of the Internet) has been shaped by rapid and inexpensive exchange of people, products, and ideas around the globe. The global sharing of ideas and information requires a new kind of "knowledge worker" that have adapted their existing professions or created new professions to manage information technology. These advances empower human resource managers to communicate with, train, motivate, and manage data about current and prospective employees in real-time around the globe, with all the potential risks and liabilities that come with such power.

3. The accommodation, not assimilation, of workers with diverse abilities, backgrounds, experiences, and skills is necessary as businesses recruit from a more heterogeneous workforce and do business in the global marketplace. Human resource managers are tasked with creating a corporate culture that embraces diversity, while managing accountability to that culture and compliance with applicable laws and norms. This concept of accommodating employees as individuals often means a shift from treating all employees (and potential employees) as alike, and instead, intentionally working with the differing needs of individuals.

4. Employees do not leave their individual values at the door when reporting for work, and for a growing number of employees, those values include the importance of family, recreation, and personal goals, often above professional goals. Ubiquitous global communication both helps and hinders the idea of balance between work and life goals, allowing employees flexibility in when, where, and how employees work, and allowing employers to be more demanding of when, where, and how employees work. Human resource managers who create aa positive culture around work/life balance will give their companies a competitive edge in employee recruitment and retention.

5. Knowledge workers use information (usually facilitated by technology) in decision making. Human resource managers must continue to recruit with purpose, adapting to new technologies in advertising positions and résumé management, while selecting employees with both the "hard" skills necessary for success in a role and the "soft" skills and attitude necessary to fit the culture of a team or company. Once hired, human resource managers must keep knowledge workers engaged and productive, a challenge given their productivity often cannot be measured in sales figures or widget production. Additionally, human resource managers must maintain a culture of productivity within the context of work/life balance when knowledge work is not necessarily tied to a traditional nine-to-five workday in a traditional office.

6. Companies seek efficiencies in all areas, including labor costs. Human resource managers play a role in maintaining employee morale and maximizing worker productivity through effective communication and management of employee retraining, compensation changes, workforce reductions through attrition, workforce reductions through layoffs, "offshoring" of work, automation of work, and mergers with and acquisitions of other companies. During recessions or other unfavorable economic conditions, human resource managers can effectively become the "voice" of a company to its workers and, through them, the public.

7. A contingent workforce (workers employed on a part-time, temporary, contract, or other as-needed basis) is an efficiency that helps human resource managers control labor costs. This workforce is managed in such a way to maximize flexibility for a company, allowing it to quickly respond to demand during peak times or for specialized projects and skills. From a human resource management perspective, contingent workers are often treated differently by company policy (especially policy concerning compensation), labor law, union contracts, and tax code than their full-time counterparts with whom they may work side-by-side. Additionally, human resource managers must effectively recruit, train, retain, and manage contingent workers while not disrupting its regular workforce or the culture of a company. 

8. Employee empowerment allows individual employees or teams to respond to changing business conditions by contributing to decision making processes, often allowing for greater creativity in problem solving. Additionally, empowered employees feel part of their organization, increasing employee interest in a company's success. To be effective, this kind of employee engagement requires interpersonal and leadership skills in all employees. Human resource managers must recruit and train with these skills on mind.

9. A company's code of ethics defines its notions of right and wrong. Note that right, wrong, and legal are three overlapping concepts, but that legal does not necessarily imply "right" and illegal does not necessarily imply "wrong." In both internal and external matters, companies are judged favorably or unfavorably by weighting their conduct against their ethical codes (as well as compliance with applicable laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act). Personally and professionally, I value integrity highly. For this reason, I am fortunate to work for a company (Apple, Inc.) whose semiannual "Business Conduct" training invokes a quote attributed to Martin Luther King, Jr.: "The time is always right to do what's right."
